Please access https://bitly.com/IBM-Argus to give a look at Argus running.

The sites where Argus is looking at ProxyIt feature are safe; Try to paste some words from the sites and search some data in SearchIt too :)

For now you will not be able to add url - because argus needs **an extra infra** ;) - BUT soon the trial version will guide you to do that :D

~if you really want NOW to add an URL call me at slack (Will Steinagel)
